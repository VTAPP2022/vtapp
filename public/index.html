      content="Welcome to VTAPP 2023, VIT AP University’s annual technical fest. Join us in celebrating innovation, knowledge, technology, and diversity through a multitude of events which will give students a platform to showcase their learning and demonstrate their technical skills. This year’s theme is “The Matrix”. Much like how the body, the mind and the brain sync together to reflect power, individuality, and humanity in the matrix, at VTAPP, infrastructural facilities, students and ideas will come together to create magic."

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
