### Hackathon Spirit 
Hackathons are like marathons: Some people go to compete but most people take part to better themselves and have fun. Whatever the reason is youâ€™re at a hackathon, make sure youâ€™re upholding the spirit of the hackathon by collaborating with other teams, helping beginners, and having fun.

## The rules of the competition
- You must treat all team members, competitors, judges, coaches, volunteers, etc, with respect and courtesy.
- Hackathon teams will be a maximum of 4 people
- All prizes are to be shared between all team members
- Teams should be made up exclusively of students or EMCRs who are not organizers, volunteers, judges, sponsors, or in any other privileged position at the event.
- All team members should be present at the event. Leaving the venue for some time to hack elsewhere is fine.
- Teams can of course gain advice and support from organizers, volunteers, sponsors, and others.
- All work on a project should be done during the hackathon.
- Teams can use libraries, frameworks, or open-source code in their projects. Working on a project before the event and open-sourcing it for the sole purpose of using the code during the event is against the spirit of the rules and is not allowed.
- Teams must stop hacking once the time is up. However, teams are allowed to debug and make small fixes to their programs after time is up.
- Teams can be disqualified from the competition at the organizersâ€™ discretion. Reasons might include but are not limited to breaking the Competition Rules, behaving in a way that violates the rules and regulation or other unsporting behaviour.
